- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnnieOhlen
- 👀 I’m interested in web developement and user focused design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I am attending a two year long education to become a system developer, focused on .NET, it started in September 2022 and is expected to finish by the end of May 2024. I am using GitHub to upload school assignments and other things that I create to learn.
